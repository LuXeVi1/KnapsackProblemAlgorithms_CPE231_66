```
- `capacity`: The maximum weight of the knapsack.
- `n`: The number of items.
- `weights[]`: Array of item weights.
- `values[]`: Array of item values.
- **Algorithms to implement**:
  - Brute Force
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy
  - Fractional Knapsack
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - Iterative Improvement
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Decrease and Conquer
  - Space-Time Tradeoff

---

#### **2. Utilities**
- **File Handling**:
  - Functions to read input files with test cases and write results.
- **Test Case Generator**:
  - Generate random test cases with weights, values, and capacity.
- **Logger**:
  - Log execution details like algorithm performance and selected items.

---

#### **3. Main File**
- **`main.c`**:
  - Integrates all algorithms and utilities.
  - Reads configuration from `config.json`.
  - Allows the user to choose algorithms and display results.

---

#### **4. Build System**
- A **Makefile** to automate compilation and linking.
- Commands:
  - `make`: Build the project.
  - `make clean`: Remove compiled files.

---

#### **5. Testing**
- Write unit tests for each algorithm and utility function.

---

### **Deliverables:**
- Complete, clean, and modular C code for the above structure.
- Well-commented and documented code.
- A `README.md` with instructions to build and run the project.

**Prompt for New Chat:**

Hello! I have a project for solving the Knapsack Problem using multiple algorithms, and I’d like your assistance with it. The project contains various files organized in a specific structure. Here’s an overview of what’s included:

### **Project Overview:**
The project is designed to solve the Knapsack Problem using multiple algorithms in C. The algorithms are modular and each has its own file. The main entry point for the program is `main.c`, which integrates the different algorithms. The project includes utilities for reading input, generating test cases, logging, and performing the actual algorithm computations.

### **Project Structure:**
The project directory structure is organized as follows:

```
/knapsack_project/

├── Makefile                       # Build automation
├── config.json                    # Configuration file (e.g., thresholds, items, test cases)
├── README.md                      # Documentation for the project
```

### **Main Components:**
1. **Algorithms**:
   - The project implements various algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem:
     - **Brute Force**: Enumerates all possible combinations of items.
     - **Dynamic Programming**: Uses a 2D table for optimization.
     - **Greedy**: Selects items based on the highest value-to-weight ratio.
     - **Fractional Knapsack**: Allows fractional items to be included.
     - **Genetic Algorithm**: Uses evolutionary techniques for optimization.
     - **Iterative Improvement**: Starts with a solution and iteratively improves it.
     - **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks the problem into smaller subproblems.
     - **Decrease and Conquer**: Solves progressively smaller problems.
     - **Space-Time Tradeoff**: Optimizes time at the expense of space.

2. **Utilities**:
   - **File Handling**: Reads test cases and writes results.
   - **Test Case Generator**: Generates random test cases for the algorithms.
   - **Logger**: Logs the performance and results of the algorithms.
   - **Device Info**: Provides system-related information.

3. **Configuration**:
   - The project uses a `config.json` file for storing configuration details like test cases, thresholds, and parameters for the algorithms.

4. **Main File (main.c)**:
   - The `main.c` file serves as the entry point of the program. It allows users to select the algorithm, enter the necessary input data (like item weights, values, and knapsack capacity), and displays the results.

5. **Testing**:
   - There are unit tests for each algorithm and utility to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

6. **Makefile**:
   - The project uses a `Makefile` to automate the building and linking of the program.

### **What I Need Help With:**
I need help in finalizing the project by:
1. Writing the implementation of the various Knapsack algorithms.
2. Ensuring all the components (utilities, algorithms, and tests) work seamlessly together.
3. Assisting with the configuration and testing process to ensure that all algorithms perform correctly on different test cases.

I hope this helps clarify the structure of the project. Let me know if you need further details or if you have specific questions about any part of the project!

Let me know if this prompt works for you or if you’d like me to adjust anything!


Please help me write a C implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem using a bruteforce approach. I need a function with the following signature:
int bruteforceKnapsack(int n, int maxWeight, Product* products)

Key requirements:
- Generate all possible combinations of items
- Ensure the total weight does not exceed maxWeight
- Maximize the total cost of selected items
- Mark selected items with isPick flag
- Return the maximum total cost achievable

Explain the algorithm's logic step-by-step:
- How will you generate all combinations?
- What approach will you use to track the best solution?
- How will you handle weight and cost constraints?
- Discuss the time complexity (expected to be O(2^n))

Provide a detailed implementation with clear comments explaining each step of the logic.
